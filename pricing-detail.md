This page is meant to clarify pricing details. You may have been linked to this page by me via email, if we are discussing your project. It's a publicly accessible page, though, so if you've found it on your own, please feel free to use it to get a general idea for your project's pricing---but I recommend contacting me with your manuscript so I can help.
