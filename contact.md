The best way to contact me is by [email](mailto:phillip@gessertbooks.com). I'm very responsive and usually reply within one working day. 

If you've got a finished manuscript, please feel free to include it with your message---it will make it easier to discuss your project, and is usually the first thing I ask for. Your manuscript is kept completely private and is not shared with anyone.

I don't discuss project details by phone, IM or Skype. No exceptions, please don't insist.
