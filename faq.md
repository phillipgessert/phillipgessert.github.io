# What file formats do you accept?

I prefer **Microsoft Word** format, but can also accept Apple Pages, Google Docs, RTF, Markdown, or most any other text format. 

# What file formats will I receive?

I provide fully tested and validated **ePub** and **MOBI** files for ebook, and print-ready **PDF** for print. 

# How should I set up my manuscript?

Ideally, paragraphs and headings will be defined with named Styles, and the source Word DOC has minimal local formatting overrides. But generally speaking, so long as I can understand your books structure and hierarchy, and can identify one section from another, **I can work with your file**.

# What is your typical turn time?

Most books are completed within **a week**, though this can vary based on complexity and project schedule. If yours is an especially complex format, you’ll receive regular updates to progress on your project.

Rush processing is available for $50.

# Can I use images for section breaks, chapter heads, etc?
 
**Yes**—I can use your provided images for $20 per 10 images, or I can create custom images for you. The fee for custom images will depend on complexity; for more information, just ask.

# Can you lay out my non-fiction book?

**Yes**—feel free to send a copy of your manuscript, I’ll be glad to quote for the work.

# Do you design book covers?

**Yes**—for work samples, check out behance.net/phillipgessert. If my style suits you, I’ll be glad to provide a quote for your project. Just ask.

# Will you proofread my book, or make corrections as you work?

The adjustments I make are all typographical in nature. I may replace three full-stops with an ellipsis character, for example—or replace two hyphens with an em-dash. However, any typos or grammatical errors in your source manuscript will remain in the finished layout, because **I don’t modify your content** (unless you ask me to: additional fees apply).

# What happens if I discover my typos after you’ve completed my layout? Or while you’re completing it?

For live projects, I include up to ten text adjustments for no cost. So if you discover a typo after I’ve already begun your project, I’ll adjust ten of them for you for free.

After ten of them, I’m glad to continue making your text adjustments at **$1** apiece.

And when the project has been completed, if you choose to make further adjustments, they’ll cost **$25 per book plus $1 per edit**.

# Will you make occasional updates to my back matter, as needed?
If you’d like to update your back matter (for example, to update an “Also By…” section), the fee for the adjustment is **$25 per book**.

# Will you upload my files for me?
**I do not** upload finished files to your author accounts, because access to your accounts reveals too much of your sensitive information to me. That information may include banking or other private details that should not be exposed to a service provider like myself. However, I’m glad to advise as best I can.

# How can I reach you?
I can also be reached by **email at pgessert@gessertbooks.com**.
