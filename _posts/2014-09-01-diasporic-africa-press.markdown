Diasporic Africa Press is a nonprofit publisher focusing on works that describe African cultural impact. I've worked with the publisher for a while, and we recently worked together to build a fresh style to flow through the works—a style that suits the content while keeping each book's style consistent but distinctive.

Many of the works include special characters, and I wanted to choose a typeface for body text that was flexible enough to handle this reliably while still carrying an appealing look. I chose [Gentium](http://scripts.sil.org/gentium): 

>…a typeface family designed to enable the diverse ethnic groups around the world who use the Latin, Cyrillic and Greek scripts to produce readable, high-quality publications. It supports a wide range of Latin- and Cyrillic-based alphabets.

I chose Seravek as a complement—it also has fairly strong support for special characters, and the pair looks great together.

	<figcaption>Color and image varies, but the overall design is consistent from volume-to-volume. This helps make each one easily identifiable as a publication of Diasporic Africa Press.</figcaption>

I always have a blast designing books for Diasporic Africa Press—largely because I always manage to learn something new as I work through them. To find out more about the publisher, including their aims and information on available books, check out [dafricapress.com](http://www.dafricapress.com).
