I had a blast working on Elliott Garber's new bio-thriller: The Chimera Sequence. We worked together to build hardcover, paperback and Kindle versions that offered the best experience for his readers, and reinforced the themes of the work without drawing too much attention to style. Elliott has a ton of design savvy and it was a real treat to work with him.
