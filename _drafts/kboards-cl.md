I'm Phillip Gessert; and I’m a book designer, typesetter and print/ebook formatter in Amarillo, TX. I began building books full time in 2011, and am especially passionate about page typography. I pride myself on building books to the highest standard of quality, both aesthetically and functionally.

I provide fully validated ePub and MOBI files, suitable for publishing on the Kindle Store and other retailers. All ebooks are created using hand-coded HTML & CSS, and take the unique considerations for different devices into account. The books are built to be flexible and render predictably across a range of e-readers. And I use traditional and classical typographical principles to give the books an appealing look.

I also provide PDF files suitable for print. I’m happy to build to Createspace or Ingram specifications, or simply build to industry-standard print-readiness. I use my pre-press experience to preflight and prepare PDF files that most any print service provider would be delighted to receive.

Book Formatting
===============

Prices assume a manuscript in clean Word DOCX format. Additional fees apply for cleanup of the source Word DOC, if cleanup is necessary. Please see below. I ask a 50% deposit via PayPal when the project begins.

Ebooks
======

All ebooks are handcoded and built for quality across devices. They're optimized for size and performace, and are made with classic typographical principles in mind.

They include working HTML and logical Tables of Contents, all appropriate metadata, page breaks per-chapter, and every convention expected of a well-formed ebook. Finished files are provided in Kindle and ePub formats.

Print books
===========

All print layouts are built to traditional bookmaking conventions, and include frontmatter, backmatter (as needed), Tables of Contents (where appropriate) and considerate handling of spreads. Every effort is made to build books with beautiful typography that emphasizes your content, and does not draw attention to itself. The aim is to create a pleasant read that helps readers understand and appreciate your work.

Finished files are provided as print-ready PDF.
