# Schedule

This calendar shows my availability. If you would like to book a specific date, please check the calendar to be sure it is available. If you do not have a specific date, or if your desired date is unavailable, your project will be scheduled into the earliest available slot.

You'll want a consecutive stretch of at least three or four days for fiction, and possibly more for non-fiction. Squeezing tight in between other scheduled projects is generally not a good idea, because unexpected issues with other projects can cause issues with yours. If you're unsure, just ask.
