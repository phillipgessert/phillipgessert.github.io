# Book Formatting

Prices assume a manuscript in clean Word DOCX format. Additional fees apply for cleanup of the source Word DOC, if cleanup is necessary. Please see below. I ask a 50% deposit when the project begins.

## Ebooks

All ebooks are handcoded and built for quality across devices. They're optimized for size and performace, and are made with classic typographical principles in mind.

They include working HTML and logical Tables of Contents, all appropriate metadata, page breaks per-chapter, and every convention expected of a well-formed ebook. Finished files are provided in Kindle and ePub formats.

## Print books

All print layouts are built to traditional bookmaking conventions, and include frontmatter, backmatter (as needed), Tables of Contents (where appropriate) and considerate handling of spreads. Every effort is made to build books with beautiful typography that emphasizes your content, and does not draw attention to itself. The aim is to create a pleasant read that helps readers understand and appreciate your work.

Finished files are provided as print-ready PDF.
